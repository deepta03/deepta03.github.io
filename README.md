# How to Host Your First Resume on GitHub Pages

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to show step by step how to host a resume online using Markdown, Jekyll and GitHub Pages. This will also explore how these steps relate to the general principals of current technical writing described in Andrew Etterâ€™s book [Modern Technical Writing.](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS)

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for this task is to have a resume ready for the desired position. However, it needs to be formatted in Markdown. So, It is recommended to have some prior research done on it.

Let's take a look at my [resume](https://github.com/deepta370/deepta370.github.io/blob/main/index.md) to see how a Markdown formatted document looks like.
